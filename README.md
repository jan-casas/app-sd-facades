## Description

This project is a Python-based web application designed to provide an interactive interface for visualizing and
analyzing geographic data. It leverages GIS (Geographic Information System) capabilities to allow users to interact with
maps, perform spatial queries, and carry out geoprocessing tasks.

The application is built with a modular architecture, with separate components for handling user interface callbacks,
core logic, and page layouts. It also includes a set of utility scripts for common tasks.

The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and consistent runtime environment. It also includes
comprehensive documentation to help users understand the API endpoints, entity relationships, and other aspects of the
application.

The application can be customized and extended to suit a variety of use cases in fields such as urban planning,
environmental management, transportation, and more.
